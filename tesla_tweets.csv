Highlights

In Q1, Giga Berlin achieved a production rate of 5k Model Y/week.

Cybertruck equipment installation continued in Q1, with production remaining on track to start later this year.

We achieved 44% growth in vehicle production & 36% growth in deliveries YoY, despite Q1 historically being the most challenging quarter for the auto industry.

Giga Shanghai has been successfully running near full capacity for several months & remains our main export hub.

Energy storage deployments increased by 360% YoY to 3.9 GWh—by far the highest level we have achieved.

2022 Highlights

Last year, our customers avoided releasing about 13.4 million metric tons of CO2e into our atmosphere 🌎

Tesla vehicle emissions are significantly lower vs ICE vehicles. This will continue to improve as the grid gets cleaner, while the carbon impact of ICE vehicles remains the same every year.

After 17 years of driving—the average life of a vehicle in the US—a single Tesla will avoid almost 55 tons of CO2e.

Also, the Supercharger network continues to be 100% renewable. This was achieved via onsite resources & annual renewable matching.",1.0
"Each Gigafactory we build is more efficient than the last, reducing our vehicles' carbon footprint further.

This includes improving factory layouts, covering roof space with solar panels & leveraging AI to improve how we use energy.

We also reduced water use in vehicle manufacturing by 15% year over year & currently use less water per vehicle than almost any ICE carmaker.

—

We support responsible mining & refining.

Specifically:

- We source directly from mining & refining companies. Avoiding the middleman enables more transparent & easily traceable supply chain data.

- We use external mining initiatives & expect suppliers to undergo independent audits.

In addition, vertical integration & regionalization help us have more control over supply.

None of our batteries go to landfills—at the end of their usable life, we recycle them to build brand-new battery packs.

—

Product affordability is fundamental to our mission.

The more products we sell, the more we move in the needle in favor of a sustainable future. Model 3 is the first EV to be priced on-par with ICE vehicle equivalents.

Tesla vehicles are engineered to be the safest in the world.

By collecting anonymous data from 4M+ vehicles in our fleet & replicating real-world accidents, we’re able to make current & future vehicles even safer.

In 2022, a Tesla with Autopilot engaged experienced 0.18 accidents per million miles driven, while the US average was more than 8x higher.",1.0

This facility will also prioritize the elimination of a challenging refinery byproduct (sodium sulfate). 

Instead, the byproduct is a mixture of sand & calcium carbonate—a viable additive in the production of construction materials, allowing us to make use of this waste stream. 

In the future, we will also process other intermediate lithium feedstocks, including those from recycled batteries & manufacturing scrap.",1.0

Highlights

In Q2, we produced a record number of vehicles, thanks to ongoing ramps of our new factories & strong performance of Shanghai & Fremont.

Cybertruck equipment installation at Giga Texas is in progress, with deliveries remaining on track to start later this year!

Yield of our in-house 4680 cell production lines continues to increase. We’re also building capacity for cathode production & lithium refining in the US.

S3XY market share is growing globally!

Model Y was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in the first half of the year in Europe—thank you to our European owners!

Autonomy at scale is achieved by:
- Extremely large real-world data set
- Neural net training
- Vehicle hardware
- Vehicle software
—all of which we develop in house.

Recently, we have started production of Dojo, our training computer, which is expected to make neural net training faster & cheaper",1.0
